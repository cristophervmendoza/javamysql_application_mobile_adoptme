3.  **Configuration:** Update the database connection settings (URL, username, password) in the **backend application's** configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`).

### 2. Mobile Application Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    cd javamysql_application_mobile_adoptme
    ```
2.  **Open in IDE:** Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  **API Endpoint:** Update the **API endpoint URL** within the mobile application's source code (where it connects to the backend) to match your running backend server's address.
4.  **Run:** Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical Android device.
